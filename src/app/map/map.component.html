<div class="top-bar">
    <h1>What does the map higher level function do??</h1>
</div>

<p>
    A Higher Order Function is any function that returns a function when executed, takes a function as one or more of its arguments, or both. If you have used any of the Array methods like map or filter, or passed a callback function to jQueryâ€™s $.get, you have already worked with Higher Order Functions.
